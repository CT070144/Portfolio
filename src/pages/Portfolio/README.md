## CSS Architecture

### Modular SCSS

- Hover effects and transitions
- Component-specific variables

### CSS Variables
Global CSS variables for:
- Breakpoints
- Container max-widths
- Colors and spacing

### Utility Classes

## Performance Considerations

### CSS Optimization

  return <Portfolio />;
}
```
